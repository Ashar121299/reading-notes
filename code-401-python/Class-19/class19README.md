## What is the Django?

Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the 
code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation. However, I find that even 
professional Django developers have little insight into “how” Django is actually run, both technically and legally/financially, so this post is my attempt to provide 
a concise overview of it all.
