#### The main important thing in React and component is dealing with website as a collection of component that have thier fuctionality ,behavioral whichs make it reusability.


##### What is a “component”?
"A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture".

##### What are the characteristics of a component?
1.Reusability  _be reused in different situations in different applications._ 

2.Replaceable _be freely substituted with other similar components._

3.Not context specific _designed to operate in different environments and contexts._

4.Extensible  _be extended from existing components to provide new behavior._

5.Encapsulated _allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes._

6.Independent  _have minimal dependencies on other components._

#### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
1.Ease of deployment  _easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole._

2.Reduced cost _spread the cost of development and maintenance._

3.Ease of development _implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality._ 

4.Reusable _can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems._

5.Modification of technical complexity _through the use of a component container and its services._

6.Reliability _reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system._

7.System maintenance and evolution _Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system._

8.Independent _Independent development of components by different group in parallel._

### What is “props” short for?
stands for Properities.
### How are props used in React?
moving data from one component to other one .
### What is the flow of props? 
the way of passing data between component which one way direction.


**_the idea of component architecture its similar to the DOM that we are taken in prep course , which to divide content of site to multiple component and each one have own functionality and properites_**

## Things I want to know more about :
1.How to do that practically ?
